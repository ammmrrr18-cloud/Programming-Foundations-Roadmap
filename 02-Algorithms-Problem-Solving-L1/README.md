# 🧩 02 - Algorithms and Problem Solving – Level 1

> **"Learn How to Think Before You Learn How to Code."** 💡

📌 This repository documents the second step of my journey. After building the mental model in Level 1, this stage is entirely dedicated to the most critical skill in software engineering: **Problem Solving.** ## 🗝️ About This Level (Thinking Independent of Syntax)
In this level, I learned that programming is **not** about a specific language; it’s about the logic used to solve a problem. I focused on analyzing, breaking down, and designing solutions **before** writing a single line of code.

### 1️⃣ The Essence of Algorithms
* **Beyond Definitions:** I learned what an algorithm really is—a step-by-step logical path to a solution.
* **Tool vs. Skill:** I treated programming languages as mere tools, while focusing on the core skill: **Algorithmic Thinking.**

### 2️⃣ Problem Analysis & Decomposition
* **Breaking It Down:** Mastered the art of breaking complex problems into simple, manageable logical steps.
* **Input-Process-Output (IPO):** Learned to identify exactly what data comes in, how it should be processed, and what the expected output is.

### 3️⃣ Visual Logic with Flowcharts
* **Visualizing Decision Making:** Used **Flowcharts** to design and visualize the logic and flow of 50 different problems.
* **Logical Structuring:** Built the ability to see the "path" of a program from start to finish without being distracted by code syntax.

### 4️⃣ Practice-Driven Reasoning
* **50-Problem Challenge:** Solved 50 carefully selected problems to train my mind on different types of logic and reasoning.
* **No Shortcuts:** Followed a strict methodology of logical analysis and step-by-step reasoning for every single problem.

## 🚀 Final Outcome
By completing this level, I developed a **Problem Solver’s Mindset**. I can now:
- ✅ Approach any problem with confidence and structure.
- ✅ Avoid the "trial-and-error" guessing game that many beginners fall into.
- ✅ Build a rock-solid logical foundation that makes learning any language (like C++) much faster and deeper.
