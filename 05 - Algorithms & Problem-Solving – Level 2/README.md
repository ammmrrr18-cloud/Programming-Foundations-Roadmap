# 🚀 05 - Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2

> **"Practice builds experience. Experience builds real programmers."** 🧠

📌 This repository documents the fifth stage of my journey. After mastering Clean Code, this level was all about **Practice and Experience**. I tackled 50 new, more complex challenges to bridge the gap between simple problems and real-world projects.

## 🗝️ About This Level (The Path to Mastery)
In this level, the focus shifted from just "knowing" to **"doing"**. I learned that experience isn't given; it's built through repetition, failure, and refinement. I faced harder problems that pushed my logical boundaries.

### 1️⃣ Advanced Problem Solving
* **Harder Challenges:** Solved a new set of 50 programming problems, significantly more complex than Level 1.
* **Attempt → Fail → Learn:** Embraced the professional mindset of trying, failing, and learning from expert solutions to improve my own logic.

### 2️⃣ Pattern Recognition & Speed
* **Identifying Patterns:** Developed the ability to recognize common problem patterns, allowing me to solve complex issues faster and with more confidence.
* **Refining Logic:** Applied Clean Code and **Divide & Conquer** principles under the pressure of more difficult logic.

### 3️⃣ Practical Projects & Experience
* **Project 1: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
  * A full-featured game that integrates **20+ programming concepts** including Enums, Structs, and AI logic.
* **Project 2: Math Quiz (Bonus Project)**
  * A logic-driven application focused on algorithmic thinking, random number generation, and score management.
* **Architecture:** Both projects were built using **Divide & Conquer** and **Clean Code** principles to ensure scalability and readability.

### 4️⃣ Building Professional Experience
* **Professional Exposure:** Studied professional solutions to learn new ideas and approaches that go beyond basic syntax.
* **Repetition & Reflection:** Focused on building experience through structured practice and reflecting on every mistake to grow as a developer.

## 🚀 Final Outcome
By completing this level, I have evolved from a "problem solver" into a "practitioner." I am now able to:
- ✅ Solve intermediate-level algorithmic problems with ease.
- ✅ Transition confidently from individual tasks to full project development.
- ✅ Apply professional patterns and experience rather than just guessing.

## 🎓 Certification
This level concludes with a **Professional Certificate in Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2**, verifying my practical growth and readiness for advanced programming challenges.
