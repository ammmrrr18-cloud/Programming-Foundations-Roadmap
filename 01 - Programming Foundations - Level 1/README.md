# 📘 01 - Programming Foundations - Level 1 (Mental Model)

> **"The goal here is not to write code; the goal is to understand how the machine thinks and how to build programming logic before even touching the keyboard."** 🧠

📌 This repository documents my journey through **Programming Foundations – Level 1**, where the focus was on building the correct mental model for programming before writing a single line of code.

## 🗝️ Educational Journey Details (In-Depth Learning)

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Essence of Data & Processing
* **Information Hierarchy:** I mastered how **Raw Data** transforms into **Information**, then into **Knowledge**, and finally into **Wisdom** for making programmatic decisions.
* **Hardware Interaction:** I gained a deep understanding of computer internal components (**CPU, RAM, Storage**) and how they interact with the code we write.

### 2️⃣ The Language of Numbers & Machines (Number Systems)
* **Beyond Zeros & Ones:** Binary is no longer a mystery; I now understand how computers represent everything (images, text, numbers) through it.
* **System Conversions:** I became proficient in converting between different systems (**Hexadecimal, Octal, Decimal**) and using the **Programmer’s Calculator** professionally.
* **Memory Management:** I learned precise measurement units from **Bit** and **Byte** up to the **Nibble**, and how to manage memory space efficiently.

### 3️⃣ Behind the Scenes of Execution (Under the Hood)
* **Language Levels:** I learned the fundamental difference between **High-Level** and **Low-Level** programming languages.
* **Translation Process:** I explored the roles of **Compilers, Interpreters, Assemblers, and Linkers**, and how source code is transformed into instructions the processor understands.

### 4️⃣ The First Programming Logic
* **Building Blocks:** I studied the essentials of any program: from defining **Variables** and **Constants** to understanding **Data Types**.
* **Logic Priorities:** I mastered the priorities of arithmetic and logical operations, which is the critical rule for preventing future bugs.

## 🚀 Final Outcome
I emerged from this level with a true **"Programmer's Mindset."** I now understand why programming languages work the way they do, how code interacts with hardware, and how to think logically before writing any code.
