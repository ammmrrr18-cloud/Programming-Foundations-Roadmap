# 🧠 07 - Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3

> **"You don't become a programmer by learning more; you become one by practicing more."** 🚀

📌 This repository documents the seventh stage of my journey. This level is where accumulated knowledge transforms into **Programming Maturity**. I tackled 51 new challenges and built two core educational projects to simulate real-world data management.

## 🗝️ About This Level (The Bridge to Maturity)
This level focuses on applying advanced C++ knowledge into complex logic, moving from solving isolated problems to building integrated educational systems.

### 1️⃣ Advanced Problem Solving (51 Challenges)
* **Increased Complexity:** Tackled **51 new programming problems**, specifically selected to be more challenging than Level 2.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Developed a deeper ability to recognize complex problem patterns and apply efficient solution strategies.
* **Decomposition:** Refined the art of breaking down large problems into small, manageable units (Divide & Conquer).

### 2️⃣ Programming Maturity & Speed
* **Pressure Testing:** Applied everything learned in previous courses under the pressure of harder algorithmic logic.
* **Accuracy & Confidence:** Improved speed and accuracy, moving from "guessing" to "applying experience."
* **Clean Code Consistency:** Maintained professional clean code standards even when the logic became highly complex.

### 3️⃣ Practical Educational Projects
* **Project 1: Bank System (Version 1)**
  * A foundational project focused on core data operations, user interaction, and structured data handling.
* **Project 2: Bank System Extension**
  * An advanced extension of the first project, introducing more complex features and refining the system's logic and scalability.
* **Logic Integration:** These projects served as a bridge, integrating **20+ programming concepts** (Structs, Enums, File Handling, and Logic Validation) into a functional educational system.

### 4️⃣ Experience vs. Theory
* **Practice-Heavy Learning:** Focused on exposure to professional solutions to learn techniques that theory alone cannot provide.
* **Repetition & Reflection:** Built a solid foundation of experience through repeated practice and constant refinement of my approaches.

## 🚀 Final Outcome
By completing this level, I have reached a stage of **Programming Maturity**. I am now able to:
- ✅ Handle complexity with confidence and structure.
- ✅ Solve advanced algorithmic problems independently.
- ✅ Build integrated educational systems with clear architectural thinking.
- ✅ Feel fully prepared for advanced software engineering and real-world systems.
