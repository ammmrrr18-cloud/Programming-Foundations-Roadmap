# 🚀 08 - Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 4

> **"Real programming maturity comes from scale, pressure, and repetition."** 🧠

📌 This repository documents the eighth stage of my journey. At this level, experience is no longer optional—it defines my capability. This stage was designed to push my limits through volume, higher difficulty, and system-level project thinking.

## 🗝️ About This Level (Advanced Practice at Scale)
After building a solid foundation in the previous levels, this course focuses on **Endurance and Consistency**. It’s about maintaining clean structure and logical control even when building integrated and evolving systems.

### 1️⃣ Advanced Problem Solving (65 Challenges)
* **High Volume & Diversity:** Solved **65 new programming problems**, designed to be more complex and varied than those in Level 3.
* **Sustained Logical Pressure:** Strengthened analytical speed and decision-making by solving large sets of problems without losing code quality.

### 2️⃣ Practical System Projects
* **Project 1: Bank System Extension 2**
  * A major expansion and continuation of the bank project from Level 3. It introduces advanced administrative features, enhanced data security, and complex user permission logic.
* **Project 2: ATM System**
  * A realistic simulation of an ATM interface. It focuses on secure user authentication, balance management, and transaction operations (withdrawal/deposit) linked to the bank's data.
* **Architecture:** Both projects were built using professional standards, ensuring clear separation of concerns and robust error handling in large codebases.

### 3️⃣ Programming Endurance & Maturity
* **Handling Scale:** Learned to maintain a clean structure across larger codebases and handle complex logic without losing control.
* **System-Level Thinking:** Transitioned naturally from solving isolated algorithmic problems to approaching projects with a holistic, system-level perspective.

## 🚀 Final Outcome
By completing this level, I have transformed accumulated practice into **Professional Programming Maturity**. I am now able to:
- ✅ Maintain clean code structure across large and complex codebases.
- ✅ Build and evolve integrated systems like Bank Extensions and ATM Systems.
- ✅ Face professional programming challenges and advanced software engineering topics.
